# Cross-machine memory with GBrain sync

gstack writes a lot of useful state to `~/.gstack/` — learnings, retros, CEO
plans, design docs, developer profile. By default, all of that dies when you
switch laptops. **GBrain sync** pushes a curated subset to a private git
repo so your memory follows you across machines and becomes indexable by
GBrain.

## What you get

- Work on machine A, pick up seamlessly on machine B.
- Your learnings, plans, and designs are visible in GBrain (if you use it).
- A clean off-ramp (`gstack-brain-uninstall`) that never touches your data.
- No daemon, no system service, no background process.

## What does NOT leave your machine

By design, these stay local even when sync is on:

- Credentials: `.auth.json`, `auth-token.json`, `sidebar-sessions/`,
  `security/device-salt`
- Machine-specific state: Chromium profiles, ONNX model weights,
  caches, eval-cache, CDP-profile, one-time prompt markers
  (`.welcome-seen`, `.telemetry-prompted`, `.vendoring-warned-*`, etc.)
- Question-preferences: per-machine UX preferences
  (`question-preferences.json`, `question-log.jsonl`, `question-events.jsonl`).

The exact allowlist lives in `~/.gstack/.brain-allowlist`. The CLI manages
it; you can append your own entries below the marker line.

## First-run setup (30–90 seconds)

```bash
gstack-artifacts-init
```

The command:

1. Turns `~/.gstack/` into a git repo.
2. Asks for a remote URL (default: `gh repo create --private
   gstack-artifacts-$USER`). Any git remote works — GitHub, GitLab, Gitea,
   self-hosted.
3. Pushes an initial commit with just the config.
4. Writes `~/.gstack-artifacts-remote.txt` (URL-only, no secrets —
   safe to copy to another machine).
5. Prints the `gbrain sources add` hookup command for the brain host
   (never auto-executed — run it yourself, or on your own machine
   `bin/gstack-gbrain-source-wireup` does the same wiring) so
   `gbrain search` can index your synced learnings, plans, and designs.
   The old `gstack-brain-reader add --ingest-url ...` HTTP path was
   removed in v1.15.1.0 — it depended on a `/ingest-repo` endpoint gbrain
   never shipped.

After init, the **next skill you run** will ask you ONE question about
privacy mode:

- **Everything allowlisted (recommended)**: learnings, reviews, plans,
  designs, retros, timelines, and developer profile all sync.
- **Only artifacts**: plans, designs, retros, learnings — skip
  behavioral data (timelines, developer profile).
- **Decline**: keep everything local. You can turn sync on later with
  `gstack-config set artifacts_sync_mode full`.

Your answer is persisted. You won't be asked again.

## Cross-machine workflow

On machine A: run `gstack-artifacts-init` once. That's it — every skill
invocation now drains the sync queue at its start and end boundaries
(~200–800 ms network pause per skill).

On machine B:

1. Copy `~/.gstack-artifacts-remote.txt` from machine A to machine B
   (password manager, dotfile repo, USB stick — your call; the legacy
   `~/.gstack-brain-remote.txt` name is still recognized).
2. Run any gstack skill. The preamble sees the URL file and prints:
   ```
   BRAIN_SYNC: brain repo detected: <url>
   BRAIN_SYNC: run 'gstack-brain-restore' to pull your cross-machine memory
   ```
3. Run `gstack-brain-restore`. That clones the repo, rehydrates your
   learnings/plans/retros, and re-registers the git merge drivers.
4. Next skill: your yesterday-on-machine-A learning surfaces. That's the
   magical moment.

## Status, health, and queue depth

```bash
gstack-brain-sync --status
```

Shows: the status (`ok`, `idle`, `held`, `blocked`, `push_failed`,
`error`), files held back by the secret scan with their fixes, the
`drainable` count, the last sync and push times, pending queue depth, and
the current privacy mode.

Every skill run prints an `ARTIFACTS_SYNC:` line near the top of the
preamble output. When the sync is stuck it adds an
`ARTIFACTS_SYNC: attention:` line; the table of those lines and their fixes
is in [gbrain-sync-errors.md](gbrain-sync-errors.md#artifacts_sync-attention--at-skill-start).

## Privacy modes in detail

| Mode | What syncs |
|------|------------|
| `off` | Nothing (default). |
| `artifacts-only` | Plans, designs, retros, learnings, reviews. Skips timelines + developer-profile. |
| `full` | Everything in the allowlist, including behavioral state. |

Change anytime with:
```bash
gstack-config set artifacts_sync_mode full
gstack-config set artifacts_sync_mode off
```

## Secret protection

Every commit is scanned for credential-shaped content before it leaves
your machine. Blocked patterns include:

- AWS access keys (`AKIA…`)
- GitHub tokens (`ghp_`, `gho_`, `ghu_`, `ghs_`, `ghr_`, `github_pat_`)
- OpenAI keys (`sk-…`)
- PEM blocks (`-----BEGIN …-----`)
- JWTs (`eyJ…`)
- Bearer tokens in JSON (`"authorization": "…"`, `"api_key": "…"`, etc.)

If a scan hits, only the flagged file is held back (with any file coupled
to it); everything else syncs. The held file stays queued and is re-scanned
at every sync, and skill start prints:

```
ARTIFACTS_SYNC: attention: status=held held=1. The secret scan is holding back 1 file(s); everything else still syncs. See which files and how to fix them: <bin> --status
```

To remediate:

1. Run `gstack-brain-sync --status` (the line prints its absolute path). Each
   entry under `held` names the file, the scanner rule and both fixes.
2. If the match is a false positive on content you never want synced, run
   `gstack-brain-sync --skip-file <path>` to permanently exclude that path;
   `gstack-brain-sync --unskip-file <path>` undoes it.
3. Otherwise, edit the file to remove the secret; the next skill run syncs it.

There's a defense-in-depth hook at `~/.gstack/.git/hooks/pre-commit` that
runs the same scan if you manually `git commit` against the repo.

Separately (v1.63.0.0+), every push writes a tamper-evident receipt to the
egress ledger (`~/.gstack/security/egress.jsonl`) *before* anything is
sent, fail-closed: if the receipt can't be written, the push is refused
and the queue is preserved. Inspect the ledger with `gstack-egress list`
and verify its hash chain with `gstack-egress verify`.

## Two-machine conflicts

If you write on machine A and machine B the same day, both will push
append commits. Git's default would conflict at the file tail, but the
`.jsonl` and markdown files are registered with custom merge drivers:

- JSONL files use a sort-and-dedup driver that orders appends by ISO
  timestamp (falls back to SHA-256 hash of each line for determinism).
- Markdown artifacts (retros, plans, designs) use a union merge driver
  that concatenates both sides.

You shouldn't see conflict prompts. If you do (a real semantic conflict,
like two machines editing the same plan), git will stop and prompt.

## Cross-machine pull cadence

The preamble runs `git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only` once per 24 hours
(cached via `~/.gstack/.brain-last-pull`). You don't need to think about
this — it happens automatically at the first skill invocation each day.

Historical note (#2516): that daily pull refreshed only `~/.gstack` itself —
NOT the detached worktree at `~/.gstack-brain-worktree` that gbrain actually
indexes, so the brain silently served stale pages until the next
setup-gbrain/sync-gbrain run. Since this fix, the daily sync also advances
the brain worktree (`gstack-gbrain-source-wireup --advance-only`, throttled
via `~/.gstack/.brain-worktree-last-advance`); a failed advance warns instead
of failing silently, and never force-resets a dirty worktree.

## Uninstall

```bash
gstack-brain-uninstall
```

This:

- Removes `~/.gstack/.git/` and all `.brain-*` config files.
- Clears `artifacts_sync_mode` in `gstack-config`.
- Does NOT touch your learnings, plans, retros, or developer profile.

Add `--delete-remote` to also delete the private GitHub repo (GitHub only,
uses `gh repo delete`).

Re-init anytime with `gstack-artifacts-init`.

## Troubleshooting

See [gbrain-sync-errors.md](gbrain-sync-errors.md) for an index of every
error message gstack-brain may print, with problem / cause / fix for each.

## Under the hood

The architectural decisions behind this feature: allowlist over denylist
(unknown files stay local by default), preamble-boundary sync over a daemon
(no background process to babysit), a JSONL merge driver so concurrent
machines union their queues instead of conflicting, and a privacy stop-gate
that asks once before anything syncs.
