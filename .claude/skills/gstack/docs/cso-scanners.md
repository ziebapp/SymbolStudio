# Running CSO scanners

`gstack-cso scan RUN SCANNER [REQUEST.json]` collects candidate evidence through
the trusted helper when a matching qualified scanner catalog profile exists.
Recognized IDs are `gitleaks`, `osv`, `semgrep`, `zizmor`, `trivy`, and
`schemathesis`. Without a qualified profile, the command records a specific
prerequisite; static assessment and importing existing CodeQL or other SARIF
with `gstack-cso import-sarif RUN REPORT.sarif` remain available.
The returned immutable artifact can be read later with
`gstack-cso scanner-outcome RUN ARTIFACT_ID`; callers never need to open private
state files directly.

The source-controlled catalog in
[`scanner-images/catalog.json`](../lib/cso/scanner-images/catalog.json) is empty
until every release gate produces real evidence. Without a reviewed profile,
the command records a specific `not_assessed` prerequisite. Installing a
scanner on the host does not enable execution. Each profile binds a Linux
platform, immutable image digest, fixed entrypoint, absolute scanner executable,
version-probe hash, required adapter capabilities, helper ABI, and the exact
isolation-policy hash. The helper validates that catalog when it starts and has
no executable fallback.
Setup preloads the current platform's qualified scanner digests through the
trusted installation helper using anonymous public-registry access. A failed
preload or a bounded per-image/setup deadline is a nonfatal prerequisite and
never causes an audit to pull. The default is 30 seconds per declared image;
`GSTACK_CSO_IMAGE_PULL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=120` selects a longer allowance (accepted
range: 5–300 seconds) while the complete preload remains capped at one hour. Doctor is
read-only and reports each scanner unavailable unless its exact catalog digest
is already present locally.

All scanner processes use Docker containment with a watchdog, shared admission
limits, read-only source, bounded output, and an isolated network namespace.
Static scanners have no network access, including when the audit omits
`--offline`. Semgrep rules and OSV/Trivy databases must be baked into the reviewed
image. Their content hashes, scope, and freshness accompany the result. Database
refresh is a separately reviewed image acquisition/release operation; scans
never download missing assets or switch to unrestricted registry networking.

`REQUEST.json` can select an exact scanner `profile`. Schemathesis additionally
requires comprehensive mode and an `api` object; `gstack-cso schema` describes
its fields. The API harness supplies a bounded OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 JSON document,
1–20 unique path operation IDs, a qualified application runtime, an absolute
start command, a numeric loopback port, a legitimate HTTP control, and the
source files defining the security boundary. Internal schema references are
allowed. Server overrides, remote references/examples, hooks, callbacks, and
webhooks are rejected. The application must boot and pass the control before
the scanner starts. Application and scanner share only the admitted loopback
namespace. An API failure is a candidate, never a reproduced vulnerability or
certified repair. Sources needing dependency preparation report that prerequisite
until a prepared offline closure is available to the API runner.

Each execution probes the scanner version before scanning and validates the
retained source both before and after collection. Unknown output, failed
diagnostics, a timeout, changed source, or incomplete cleanup cannot become an
empty clean result. The helper retains valid partial candidates when the
adapter can distinguish them from failed coverage. Scanner output is redacted
in place: each located sensitive span becomes a `<REDACTED-...>` marker, so an
advisory URL or version string that resembles a phone number or IP address does
not discard the whole report. Output that cannot be redacted, including a span
split across stdout and stderr, is withheld.

Scanner and SARIF collection hold the run's mutation lock and reject finished
or interrupted reports. Every outcome is written exclusively under a unique
`scanner-outcomes/` name before its coverage record enters the report. The
returned `artifact` path is relative to the run directory. Model submissions
cannot replace `scanner:*` coverage or certify the imported candidates. The
free scanner tests use injected runners and catalogs to verify dispatch and
failure handling; they do not claim real image qualification. The opt-in Docker
qualification test runs the production adapter, image, watchdog, and isolation
policy. It emits the version-output hash only after a representative scan
completes without a coverage gap.

The reviewed release inputs in
[`build-inputs.json`](../lib/cso/scanner-images/build-inputs.json) cover all six
scanners on both native platforms. The inputs require immutable base and SBOM-generator image digests, exact source
commits and versions, signer workflow identities and digests, and reviewed
canonical SLSA/SPDX statement-set digests. The workflow cryptographically
re-verifies each image with those repository, source, signer, and predicate
constraints before use. Semgrep additionally requires a reviewed local rules bundle. OSV and
Trivy require complete offline database bundles with recorded content hashes,
freshness, and ecosystem coverage. The release workflow does not invent or
silently replace them. None of the upstream scanner images publish GitHub
artifact attestations, so the reviewed bases come from
[`garrytan/gstack-cso-scanner-bases`](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack-cso-scanner-bases).
That repository re-publishes each pinned upstream digest with the offline assets
added and signs provenance and an SPDX SBOM with its own workflow. Each tagged
release attaches a `pending` `build-inputs.json` candidate; a reviewer
independently re-verifies the identities and hashes before the state here
changes to `reviewed`.

[`cso-scanner-images.yml`](../.github/workflows/cso-scanner-images.yml) lets a
dispatched branch run read-only input and contract validation. Image publishing,
native amd64/arm64 qualification, attestation verification, embedded-asset hash
checks, containment, real-adapter execution, and catalog-proposal generation run
only from protected `main` through the `cso-scanner-release` environment. Before
enabling qualification or promotion, configure the repository's
`cso-scanner-release` GitHub environment with required maintainer reviewers and
deployments restricted to protected `main`. GitHub otherwise creates a referenced
missing environment without protection rules. Promotion requires an explicit
dispatch from `main` and approval through that configured environment. It opens a pull request
containing only the proposed source catalog, so code review remains the final
authorization step. Pushes and pull requests made with the workflow's
`GITHUB_TOKEN` start no workflows, so after pushing the promotion branch the job
dispatches [`free-tests.yml`](../.github/workflows/free-tests.yml) on it
(`actions: write`); that run reports the required `free-tests` check on the
branch head. Opening the PR also requires the repository setting **Allow GitHub
Actions to create and approve pull requests** (Settings → Actions → General →
Workflow permissions); without it `gh pr create` fails after the push and the
dispatch, and a maintainer opens the PR from the pushed branch.
`previousRevision` records the prior compatible catalog for
rollback and must still equal the current `main` catalog when promotion runs.

Scanner flags follow the primary documentation linked in
[`scanners.ts`](../lib/cso/scanners.ts). Offline qualification must exercise
the exact chosen version: OSV's maintainers documented a cache-location
regression in 2.5.0, which demonstrates why a version string alone is insufficient.
[OSV issue #2983](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/issues/2983).
Trivy uses an explicit memory scan cache alongside read-only baked databases
and a baked misconfiguration checks bundle. Schemathesis 4.26 and later repeat
fuzzing until `--max-time` is spent, so the adapter sets that budget to three
quarters of the scanner deadline and treats a `max_time` stop as complete only
when every selected operation was exercised.
