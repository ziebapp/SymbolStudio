/**
 * CI tripwire for the silent-skip class (#audit-2026-08: the 9 make-pdf e2e
 * gate tests self-skipped on Linux for their entire life because the
 * free-tests lane never built the binaries they probe — exit 0, no signal).
 *
 * Every sibling gate file guards itself with test.skipIf(!prerequisitesAvailable()),
 * which is correct for LOCAL runs (a contributor without a build shouldn't
 * fail) but is exactly how CI green stopped meaning "ran". This file inverts
 * the polarity in CI: when GSTACK_EXPECT_BINARIES=1 (set by free-tests.yml's
 * "Run free suite" step), the prerequisites are ASSERTED, so dropping the
 * gate-build step or poppler from the workflow fails the required lane
 * instead of quietly skipping the gates.
 *
 * Not set locally → the whole file self-skips, same as the gates.
