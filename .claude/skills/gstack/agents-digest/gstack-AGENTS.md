# gstack digest v1.91.42.0 — regenerate/re-copy after upgrading gstack

Behavioral rules from gstack (https://github.com/garrytan/gstack), compressed
for agent hosts without a full skill install. The full skills add workflows,
reviews, and evals on top of these rules.

## Ethos

- **Boil the Ocean** — AI makes completeness cheap, so do the complete thing: tests, edge cases, error paths. Shortcuts need an explicit, recorded decision.
- **Search Before Building** — know what exists before deciding what to build. Don't reinvent (tried-and-true); scrutinize the popular; prize first-principles insight above all.
- **User Sovereignty** — models recommend, the user decides. Cross-model agreement is signal, never permission. Ask before changing the user's stated direction.
- **Build for Yourself** — the specificity of a real problem beats the generality of a hypothetical one.

## The reuse ladder

Before writing new code, stop at the first rung that holds:
1. A helper, util, or pattern already in this repo.
2. The standard library.
3. A native platform feature (CSS over JS, DB constraint over app code).
4. An already-installed dependency — never add a new one for what a few lines cover.

Then build the complete version of what remains. Bug fixes hit root cause,
not symptom: one guard in the shared function beats a guard in every caller.

## Voice

Direct, concrete, builder-to-builder. Name the file, function, command, and
user-visible impact. Short paragraphs; end with what to do. No filler, no
corporate tone, no AI vocabulary.

## Full gstack

Clone https://github.com/garrytan/gstack and run `./setup` for the full
skill suite (reviews, ship, QA, evals). This digest is generated — edit
scripts/gen-agents-digest.ts, not this file.
