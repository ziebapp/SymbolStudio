/**
 * Cross-platform file permission restriction for sensitive gstack state.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ----------------
 * POSIX mode bits (`0o600` for files, `0o700` for dirs) are how gstack marks
 * sensitive state files — auth tokens, PTY session state, tab context. On
 * Linux and macOS,
 * `fs.chmodSync(path, 0o600)` and `fs.writeFileSync(path, data, { mode: 0o600 })`
 * do exactly what you'd hope: the file ends up readable and writable only
 * by the owning user, no access for group / other.
 *
 * On Windows, both calls are effectively no-ops. NTFS uses ACLs, not POSIX
 * mode bits, and Node's fs module doesn't translate. So on every Windows
 * install, sensitive gstack state files inherit whatever ACL the parent
 * directory grants — typically user-full + inherited admin-full. That's
 * fine on a single-user laptop but leaks on:
 *
 *   - Self-hosted CI runners (GitHub Actions / GitLab / Jenkins agents
 *     running as a different service account on the same box — they can
 *     read developer state)
 *   - Shared development machines (agencies, studios, lab machines)
 *   - Multi-tenant servers with shared home directories
 *   - Malware running as the same user (no in-user-account isolation)
 *
 * This module wraps the platform-correct call. POSIX: chmod. Windows:
 * icacls with inheritance break + explicit user grant. Failures on either
 * platform are best-effort — the filesystem is still functional if ACL
 * restriction fails; we just don't hit the intended hardening target.
 *
 * Warning behavior: to avoid spamming the console on a machine where
 * icacls is unavailable (rare — it ships in System32 on every Windows
 * version since 7), we log the first failure per process and stay silent
 * afterward. The warning includes the advice "sensitive files may be
 * readable by other accounts on this machine" so operators know to audit
 * their runner / share setup.

 * POSIX: `fs.chmodSync(path, 0o700)`. Idempotent if the dir was already
 * created with `{ mode: 0o700 }`.
 *
 * Owner-only hardening is for directories gstack creates and owns. Two
 * pre-existing shapes must never be chmodded, so the POSIX branch refuses
 * them:
 *
 *   - A directory owned by another user. On most hosts the chmod just
 *     fails EPERM, but run as root (or with CAP_FOWNER — containers, CI
 *     sandboxes) it SUCCEEDS and takes the directory away from its owner.
 *   - A shared sticky world-writable directory (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`).
 *     Callers land here when a state file is configured directly inside
 *     the system temp dir (`BROWSE_STATE_FILE=/tmp/foo.json` makes
 *     `path.dirname()` derive `/tmp` as the state dir). A 0o700 `/tmp`
 *     locks every other process on the machine out of it: access(2)-based
 *     checks (`fs.existsSync`) return EACCES→false machine-wide, even
 *     while stat keeps working for capability-holding processes.
 *
 * Windows: `icacls /inheritance:r /grant:r <user>:(OI)(CI)(F)`. The
 * `(OI)(CI)` flags make new files (OI = object inherit) and subdirs
 * (CI = container inherit) inherit the single-user-full ACL — important
 * because child creations in `fs.writeFileSync(...)` without explicit
 * `restrictFilePermissions` still end up owner-only.
 *
 * Symlinked dirs are warned about and SKIPPED, never followed: both
 * `chmod` and `icacls` dereference the link, so restricting through a
 * symlink hardens whatever the link points at — a target the caller never
 * vetted (and, with `/inheritance:r`, one we could lock its real owner out
 * of). Skipping is best-effort-consistent with the rest of this module:
 * the filesystem stays functional, we just don't hit the hardening target.
