/**
 * acquireServerLock error honesty (#1084 regression).
 *
 * The old code wrapped fs.openSync(lockPath, 'wx') in a bare `catch {}` —
 * EVERY errno (EACCES, EIO, ENOSPC, ENOENT) fell into the "lock already
 * held" path and surfaced as "another instance is starting the server",
 * a phantom 15s contention timeout that masked the real filesystem error.
 *
 * New contract:
 *   - EEXIST + live holder  → null (real contention)
 *   - EEXIST + dead holder  → stale lock removed, acquired
 *   - ENOENT (dir missing)  → create dir, retry once, acquired
 *   - anything else         → ServerLockError with the real errno
 */
