/**
 * Static tripwire for #2220: every Playwright launch site must disable
 * Playwright's process-level signal handlers (handleSIGINT / handleSIGTERM /
 * handleSIGHUP), and server.ts must own the SIGHUP cleanup those flags
 * remove.
 *
 * WHY handleSIGTERM:false is correct here: server.ts DELIBERATELY ignores
 * SIGTERM in normal headless mode (the process.on('SIGTERM') handler —
 * Claude Code's Bash sandbox fires SIGTERM when the parent shell exits
 * between tool invocations, and the daemon must survive it). Playwright's
 * default handleSIGTERM:true registers its OWN handler that closes Chromium
 * on the same signal — so the daemon survived but its browser died out from
 * under it. With the flag false, the daemon's signal policy is the only
 * signal policy: the signals server.ts honors route through activeShutdown,
 * which closes Chromium itself.
 *
 * WHY server.ts needs a SIGHUP handler (ENG-OV4): before #2220 the daemon
 * had NO process-level SIGHUP handler — Playwright's default handleSIGHUP
 * was the only thing closing Chromium on hangup. Flipping the flag without
 * adding a handler would leak a live Chromium on every hangup.
 *
 * Source-level, same style as windows-spawn-hide.test.ts: cheap,
 * deterministic, runs on every platform.
