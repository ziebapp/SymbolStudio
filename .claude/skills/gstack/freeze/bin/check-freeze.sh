# check-freeze.sh — PreToolUse hook for /freeze skill
# Reads JSON from stdin, checks if file_path is within the freeze boundary.
# Returns a PreToolUse hookSpecificOutput with permissionDecision "deny" to block,
# or {} to allow. The decision MUST be nested under hookSpecificOutput — Claude
# Code ignores a top-level permissionDecision, which silently no-ops the block.
#
# Polarity: freeze is a DENY-tier hook, so an unreadable payload DENIES
# (fail closed). A payload that parses but has no file_path is a non-file
# tool — allow. This is the opposite edge-handling from careful's ask-tier
# and intentionally so: /guard runs both, and a boundary that fails open is
# not a boundary.
