# Migration: v1.86.0.0 — /claude becomes /claude-code on non-Claude hosts.
# Affected: existing generated skills, including copied and dangling installs.
# The same helper runs before setup builds, so replacements are installed before
# shared old renders are retired. This post-setup pass repairs missed upgrades.
# Idempotent and non-fatal: foreign entries and failed replacements stay intact.
