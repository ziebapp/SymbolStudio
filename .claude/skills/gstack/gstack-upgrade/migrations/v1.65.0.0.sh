# Migration: v1.65.0.0 — repair Chrome-for-Testing bundles poisoned by the
# old in-place rebrand (#2242).
#
# Why a migration: pre-v1.64 launchHeaded() rewrote the Chromium .app's
# Info.plist ("Google Chrome for Testing" → "GStack Browser") and overwrote
# its Resources/*.icns — inside the SHARED Playwright cache. That broke the
# codesign seal (GPU process exit_code=5; headed mode dead on macOS 26) and
# poisoned the cache for the user's OTHER Playwright projects too. Deleting
# the rebrand code fixes fresh installs only; every existing macOS install
# still has the mutated bundle on disk. This migration removes poisoned
# bundles and re-fetches a clean one so the upgrade doesn't leave the user
# with zero working browser (the browse launch path also self-heals, as the
# belt to this suspenders, for installs that never run migrations).
#
# Removal scope: `playwright install chromium` treats the revision dir's
# INSTALLATION_COMPLETE marker as "is already downloaded" — removing only
# the .app strands the user with a marker, no browser, and a re-fetch that
# no-ops. So when the poisoned .app sits in the standard cache layout
# (chromium-<rev>/chrome-mac/<name>.app) the WHOLE revision dir goes;
# otherwise the .app plus its sibling INSTALLATION_COMPLETE /
# DEPENDENCIES_VALIDATED markers go. A revision dir already stranded in
# exactly that state (markers present, .app missing) is detected and
# removed too, so the re-fetch actually downloads.
#
# Affected: macOS installs that ever ran headed mode before v1.64.
#
# Idempotent: detection is content-based (plist contains "GStack Browser");
# a clean cache is a no-op, and the .done touchfile gates re-runs. After a
# removal, .done is only written once the end state is VERIFIED (a real
# Chromium executable exists in the cache) — a removal followed by a failed
# re-fetch (e.g. offline) leaves the migration pending, with a needs-refetch
# sentinel so the next run retries the download.
