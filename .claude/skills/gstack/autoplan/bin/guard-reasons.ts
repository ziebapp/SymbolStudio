/**
 * Every /autoplan publication-guard outcome: one stable code, its disposition,
 * its text and its troubleshooting anchor. docs/autoplan-guard-troubleshooting.md
 * carries one anchor per code (test/autoplan-guard-reasons.test.ts holds both to it).
 *
 * Dispositions:
 * - `fallback`: retrying cannot help; the denial prints the supported fallback.
 * - `corrective`: the model or user must take the named action first.
 * - `transient`: names what to wait for.
 * - `unverified`: Claude Code made the session uncheckable; the call is allowed
 *   with a visible warning and a log line, and phase-report enforcement is skipped.
