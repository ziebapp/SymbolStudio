## Step 2A: Review Mode

Run Codex code review against the current branch diff.

**Scope flags exclude the prompt argument.** In `codex review [OPTIONS] [PROMPT]`, the
`[PROMPT]` positional is mutually exclusive with every scope flag — `--base`, `--commit`,
and `--uncommitted`. Passing both fails at argument parsing, before any API call:

```
error: the argument '[PROMPT]' cannot be used with '--base <BRANCH>'
```

**Do not work around this by dropping the scope flag and keeping the prompt.** A
prompt-only `codex review "<text>"` parses fine, but it silently falls back to the
**uncommitted working-tree** scope — verified on 0.144.1, where it runs
`git status --short; git diff` and reviews that. Telling the model in prompt text to
"run git diff <base>...HEAD" does not change what the CLI feeds the reviewer, so you get
a confidently-worded review of the wrong changes. The scope flag is the only thing that
sets the scope. Pass it, and pass no prompt.

This is unconditional — no `codex --version` branch. `[PROMPT]` has always been optional,
so the no-prompt form is valid on every version that supports `--base`. Custom
instructions get their own path (below).

1. Create temp files for output capture:
```bash
TMPERR=$(mktemp "$TMP_ROOT/codex-err-XXXXXX") || { echo "ERROR: mktemp failed in TMP_ROOT=$TMP_ROOT; not running codex without its temp file" >&2; exit 1; }
TMPOUT=$(mktemp "$TMP_ROOT/codex-out-XXXXXX") || { echo "ERROR: mktemp failed in TMP_ROOT=$TMP_ROOT; not running codex without its temp file" >&2; exit 1; }
```

2. Run the review. No prompt argument — scope comes from `--base` (or `--commit <sha>`
when reviewing a single commit, or `--uncommitted` for the working tree).

Use only one command path below. Remember its printed start token as CODEX_REVIEW_START before the review reads or receives the diff. Capture a new token only before a genuine rerun, never just to log fixes.

**Sandbox is pinned via config override.** Top-level `codex review` has no
`-s`/`--sandbox` flag (verified on 0.147.0: `codex review --help` lists none), so the
sandbox is set with `-c` from `_CODEX_SANDBOX_MODE`, which `select-model` reports
so the effective setting is `sandbox_mode="read-only"` (full access only for
`GSTACK_CODEX_NO_SANDBOX=1`, with a warning). Without it the call inherits the user's
`~/.codex/config.toml` default, which on a trusted project can be WRITE access —
contradicting this skill's read-only contract:

```bash
_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) || { echo "ERROR: not in a git repo" >&2; exit 1; }
cd "$_REPO_ROOT"
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-log --start codex-review
_CODEX_PROBE=~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-codex-probe
_CODEX_OUT=$("$_CODEX_PROBE" select-model review) || exit 1
_CODEX_SEL=$(echo "$_CODEX_OUT" | sed -n 's/^CODEX_SEL: //p')
_CODEX_SANDBOX_MODE=$(echo "$_CODEX_OUT" | sed -n 's/^CODEX_SANDBOX: //p')
# The 330s wrapper sits BELOW the 360s Bash gate so the wrapper fires FIRST
# and a stall surfaces as a diagnosable exit 124 with an explicit message,
# never as a silent harness kill that downstream reads as "no findings".
"$_CODEX_PROBE" run-with-timeout 330 codex review --base <base> -c "sandbox_mode=\"${_CODEX_SANDBOX_MODE:?}\"" -c "review_model=\"${_CODEX_SEL:?}\"" -c "model=\"${_CODEX_SEL:?}\"" -c skills.include_instructions=false -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"' -c 'web_search="cached"' < /dev/null >"$TMPOUT" 2>"$TMPERR"
_CODEX_EXIT=$?
cat "$TMPOUT"
if [ "$_CODEX_EXIT" = "124" ]; then
  "$_CODEX_PROBE" log-event codex_timeout "330"
  "$_CODEX_PROBE" log-hang "review" "$(wc -c < "$TMPERR" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)"
  echo "Codex stalled past 5.5 minutes. Common causes: model API stall, long prompt, network issue. Try re-running. If persistent, split the prompt or check ~/.codex/logs/."
elif [ "$_CODEX_EXIT" != "0" ]; then
  # Surface non-zero exits (parse errors, arg-shape breaks, etc.) so the
  # calling agent doesn't read "no output" as a silent model/API stall and
  # burn 30-60min misdiagnosing it.
  echo "[codex exit $_CODEX_EXIT] $(head -1 "$TMPERR" 2>/dev/null || echo "no stderr captured")"
  head -20 "$TMPERR" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^/  /' || true
  "$_CODEX_PROBE" log-event codex_nonzero_exit "review:$_CODEX_EXIT"
fi
bun ~/.claude/skills/gstack/lib/outside-review-result.ts --label 'Codex review' --exit "$_CODEX_EXIT" --stderr "$TMPERR" structured "$TMPOUT"
```

If the user passed `--xhigh`, use `"xhigh"` instead of `"high"`.

**Custom-instructions path (user typed `/codex review <focus>`):** custom instructions
cannot ride along with `--base` — that is exactly the combination the CLI rejects — and
they cannot be smuggled in by dropping `--base`, because that silently switches the scope
to the working tree. So they get their own command: `codex exec`, which still accepts a
free-form prompt, with the diff written to a tempfile and inlined into it. We preserve
the filesystem boundary here because `codex exec` is not auto-scoped to a diff the way
`codex review` is. The DIFF_START/DIFF_END delimiters tell the model where data ends and
instructions resume — a defense against prompt injection when the diff content is
adversarial.

The focus text is user input, so it travels as a file. Create it and write everything
after `/codex review ` into it:

```bash
_GT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.gstack/tmp"
mkdir -p "$_GT" && chmod 700 "$_GT" || { echo "Not sent: cannot create $_GT for the text file." >&2; exit 1; }
_EX=$(git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude 2>/dev/null) && mkdir -p "$(dirname "$_EX")" && { grep -qxF '/.gstack/tmp/' "$_EX" 2>/dev/null || echo '/.gstack/tmp/' >> "$_EX"; }
FOCUS_FILE=$(mktemp "${_GT:?}/codex-focus.XXXXXX") || { echo "Not sent: mktemp failed in $_GT." >&2; exit 1; }; echo "FOCUS_FILE: $FOCUS_FILE (name: ${FOCUS_FILE##*/})"
```

Write the text into each printed file with your file-write tool (Claude Code's Write tool needs a Read of the empty file first), exactly as it should appear. The text never goes into a shell command, heredoc or quoted argument. If a write fails or is refused, do not send: print the cause, the file path and the command below for sending by hand.

Then run, substituting the printed name for `<focus-file-name>` (letters, digits, `.`,
`_` and `-` only):

```bash
_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) || { echo "ERROR: not in a git repo" >&2; exit 1; }
cd "$_REPO_ROOT"
FOCUS_FILE="$_REPO_ROOT/.gstack/tmp/<focus-file-name>"
[ -s "$FOCUS_FILE" ] || { echo "Not run: $FOCUS_FILE is missing or empty, so the focus text was never written. Write it, then run this block again." >&2; exit 1; }

When you take this path, say so in the output header — `CODEX SAYS (code review — custom
instructions via codex exec):` — and note that the CLI does not accept custom instructions
alongside `--base`, so the scope was expressed in the prompt instead.

**Why the dual path:** The default `codex review --base` path keeps Codex's own review
prompt tuning and its authoritative diff scoping, at the cost of accepting no custom
instructions. The `codex exec` route loses that tuning but gains custom-instructions
support; the prompt explicitly demands `[P1]` / `[P2]` markers so the gate logic in step 4
still works. There is no third option that gets both — the CLI forbids it.

Use `timeout: 360000` on the Bash call for either path. The Bash gate sits ABOVE the
330s wrapper deliberately: the wrapper fires first with its explicit exit-124 message,
instead of the harness killing the call silently.

3. Capture the output. Then parse cost from stderr:
```bash
grep "tokens used" "$TMPERR" 2>/dev/null || echo "tokens: unknown"
```

4. Determine the gate verdict: **PASS**, **FAIL**, or **UNVERIFIED**. The command
above ends with the shared validator's `VERDICT:` and `FINDINGS:` lines; the checks
below are what it computes. **The gate FAILS CLOSED**: a run that did not complete is a FAIL, and output the
gate cannot check is UNVERIFIED, never a PASS. Work through these checks IN ORDER; the first
match wins:

   1. `_CODEX_EXIT` is non-zero (including 124) → **GATE: FAIL** (fail-closed:
      codex exited `$_CODEX_EXIT` — the review did not complete, so there is no
      verified result). Expired auth, a bad flag, a timeout, or a model-entitlement
      400 all land here instead of masquerading as a clean pass.
   2. The captured review output is empty or whitespace-only → **GATE: FAIL**
      (fail-closed: empty output — nothing was reviewed). Any other
      `VERDICT: unavailable` is also **GATE: FAIL**: Codex's sandbox could not
      start, every command it ran failed, or it said it could not read the diff.
      Relay the validator's `unavailable:` line; a "no findings" written after
      that is not a review.
   3. The output contains `[P0]` or `[P1]` (or codex's native unbracketed `P0:` /
      `P1:` severity labels) → **GATE: FAIL** (N critical findings). Codex's own
      review rubric treats P0 as blocking; this gate does too.
   4. The output contains NO `[P0]`–`[P3]` tag (nor native `P0:`–`P3:` labels)
      anywhere → **GATE: UNVERIFIED** (Codex completed and tagged nothing; read
      the output above). `codex review` puts severity tags only in finding titles
      and prints its structured clean verdict nowhere (verified on 0.160.0), so a
      clean review is untagged prose. "No `[P1]` substring" and "no critical
      findings" are different claims: never infer PASS from an untagged body, and
      never report it as a FAIL or a finding count either.
   5. Severity tags are present and none is P0/P1 (only P2/P3 advisory) →
      **GATE: PASS**.

   Check 3 is `VERDICT: findings`; check 4 is `VERDICT: unverified`, or
   `VERDICT: clean` with `FINDINGS: none`; check 5 is `VERDICT: clean` with
   `FINDINGS: P2` or `P3`. There is no default branch: PASS is only reachable through check 5. For FAIL
   via checks 1 or 2, say explicitly that the review did not complete. For
   UNVERIFIED, tell the user to read Codex's verdict above and decide; it is
   not a blocker by itself and not a pass.

5. Present the output:

```
CODEX SAYS (code review):
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
<full codex output, verbatim — do not truncate or summarize>
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
GATE: PASS                    Tokens: 14,331 | Est. cost: ~$0.12
```

or

```
GATE: FAIL (N critical findings)
```

or, when the run itself did not complete:

```
GATE: FAIL (fail-closed: <codex exited N | empty output> — needs human attention)
```

or, when Codex completed without severity tags:

```
GATE: UNVERIFIED (Codex completed and tagged nothing; read the output above)
```

5a. **Synthesis recommendation (REQUIRED).** After presenting Codex's verbatim
output and the GATE verdict, emit ONE recommendation line summarizing what the
user should do, in this format:

```
Recommendation: <action> because <one-line reason that names the most actionable finding>
```

Examples (the strongest reasons compare against an alternative — another finding, fix-vs-ship, or fix-order):
- `Recommendation: Fix the SQL injection at users_controller.rb:42 first because its auth-bypass blast radius is higher than the LFI Codex also flagged, and the parameterized-query fix is three lines vs the LFI's session-handling rewrite.`
- `Recommendation: Ship as-is because all 3 Codex findings are P3 cosmetic and the gate passed; addressing them would block the release without changing user-visible behavior.`
- `Recommendation: Investigate the race condition Codex flagged at billing.ts:117 before merging because the silent-corruption failure mode is harder to detect post-ship than the harness gap Codex also raised, which is fixable in a follow-up.`

The reason must engage with a specific finding (or compare against alternatives — other findings, fix-vs-ship, fix order). Boilerplate reasons ("because it's better", "because adversarial review found things") fail the format. The recommendation is the ONE line a user reads when they don't have time for the verbatim output. **Never silently auto-decide; always emit the line.**

6. **Cross-model comparison:** If `/review` (Claude's own review) was already run
   earlier in this conversation, compare the two sets of findings:

```
CROSS-MODEL ANALYSIS:
  Both found: [findings that overlap between Claude and Codex]
  Only Codex found: [findings unique to Codex]
  Only Claude found: [findings unique to Claude's /review]
  Agreement rate: X% (N/M total unique findings overlap)
```

7. Persist the review result:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-log '{"skill":"codex-review","timestamp":"TIMESTAMP","status":"STATUS","gate":"GATE","findings":N,"findings_fixed":N,"commit":"'"$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"'","completed":COMPLETED,"converged":CONVERGED}' --finish CODEX_REVIEW_START
```

Substitute: TIMESTAMP (ISO 8601), STATUS ("clean" if PASS, "issues_found" if FAIL,
"unverified" if UNVERIFIED), GATE ("pass", "fail" or "unverified" — fail-closed
verdicts log as "fail"), findings (count of [P0]–[P3] markers; 0 for fail-closed
and UNVERIFIED runs),
findings_fixed (count of findings that were addressed/fixed before shipping). If the
`WARNING: GSTACK_CODEX_NO_SANDBOX=1` line printed, add `"sandbox":"danger-full-access"` to the record.
CODEX_REVIEW_START is the original token from the command path that ran. COMPLETED is true only when the review completed with coverage of the branch diff and current working-tree changes; timeout, failure, refusal, or missing coverage is false. A limited `--commit`/`--uncommitted` review, or a committed-only custom prompt that omitted dirty/untracked source, does not establish whole-branch coverage: log completed false and explain the limitation. CONVERGED is true only for a completed pass with zero edits. Fixes stay stale until a genuine rerun reads the updated diff with a new start token. These evidence fields do not change the gate verdict above.

8. Clean up temp files:
```bash
rm -f "$TMPERR" "$TMPOUT" "$TMPOUT.events"
```
