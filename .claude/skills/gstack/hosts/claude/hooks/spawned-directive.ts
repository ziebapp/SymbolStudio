 * Shared spawned-session directive text for the AUQ hooks (#2733).
 *
 * Hook processes inherit the HARNESS env, so a per-command
 * `GSTACK_SESSION_KIND=spawned` prefix inside a subagent's bash call can
 * never reach a hook — the only levers a hook has for the subagent case are
 * (a) env-level markers that ARE session-wide (OPENCLAW_SESSION, or a harness
 * launched with GSTACK_SESSION_KIND in its env) and (b) directive TEXT the
 * model reads. Both AUQ hooks (question-preference PreToolUse deny,
 * auq-error-fallback PostToolUse directive) carry the same escape sentence;
 * it lives here as one constant so the two paths can never drift into
 * contradictory instructions.
 *
 * Destructive semantics are unified across every spawned surface (dispatch
 * prompt, spawned-session block, AUQ prose rule, both hooks):
 * conservative-continue, never prose-STOP — a prose brief with no reader is
 * always wrong in a spawned session, and the conservative choice guarantees
 * nothing irreversible happens.
