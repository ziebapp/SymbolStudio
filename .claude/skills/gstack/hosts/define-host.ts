 * tier 'experimental' with conservative capabilities (tool execution and
 * browser, prose questions, no plan mode, no delegation, advisory safety),
 * paths derived from the host name (`.{name}/skills/gstack`), allowlist
 * frontmatter (name + description), no metadata sidecar, all skills enabled,
 * the standard three-entry pathRewrite trio derived from the resolved
 * paths, the shared runtimeRoot asset list, and symlink-generated install.
 *
 * Defaults are constructed fresh per call, so no two host configs ever share
 * a mutable array/object. Optional fields that are absent today (toolRewrites,
 * coAuthorTrailer, boundaryInstruction) stay absent unless a host explicitly
 * sets them — the factory never default-populates optional fields.
