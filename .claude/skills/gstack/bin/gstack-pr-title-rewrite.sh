# Rewrite a PR/MR title to start with v<NEW_VERSION>.
#
# Usage:  bin/gstack-pr-title-rewrite.sh <NEW_VERSION> <CURRENT_TITLE>
#         gh pr view N --json title -q .title | bin/gstack-pr-title-rewrite.sh <NEW_VERSION> --stdin
# Output: corrected title on stdout. --stdin reads the title from standard
# input, so /ship pipes the platform's title through without the agent or a
# shell string ever carrying it.
#
# Rule: PR titles MUST start with v<NEW_VERSION>. Three cases:
#   1. Already starts with "v<NEW_VERSION>" -> no change.
#   2. Starts with a different "v<digits and dots>" prefix -> replace prefix.
#   3. No version prefix -> prepend "v<NEW_VERSION> ".
#
# Each version prefix may be followed by a space (then a description) OR sit at
# the end of the title as a bare version with no description (e.g. "v1.2.3", the
# format ship/CHANGELOG uses for version-only bumps). Both forms must be handled
# in cases 1 and 2, otherwise a bare version falls through to case 3 and gets a
# second prefix prepended, e.g. "v1.2.3" -> "v1.2.3.4 v1.2.3". The CI workflow
# .github/workflows/pr-title-sync.yml feeds real PR titles through this and then
# `gh pr edit`s the result, so the duplicated title would be written back.
#
# The version-prefix regex matches two or more dot-separated digit segments
# (covers v1.2, v1.2.3, v1.2.3.4) so the rule is portable across repos that
# use 3-part or 4-part versions, but does NOT strip plain words like
# "version 5".
