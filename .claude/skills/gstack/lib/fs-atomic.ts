/**
 * Atomic file writes — the ONE implementation of tmp-write-then-rename.
 *
 * Before this module, the pattern was reimplemented ~20 times across lib/,
 * bin/, and browse/src with three different tmp-suffix conventions — one of
 * which (a bare `.tmp`) carries a real collision race that browse's
 * server.ts documented after hitting it in production: two writers (batch
 * subcommands, /tunnel/start handlers, or any combination) collide on the
 * rename when the tmp filename is deterministic. The suffix here includes
 * pid AND a random component so concurrent writers in the SAME process
 * (async interleavings) can't collide either.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - atomicWriteSync ALWAYS throws on failure, after best-effort tmp cleanup.
 *   Callers own the error. Use it everywhere except shutdown paths.
 * - atomicWriteQuiet swallows everything (returns false on failure). ONLY
 *   for shutdown/emergency-cleanup paths where a throw would abort the rest
 *   of cleanup — same philosophy as browse's safeUnlinkQuiet.
 * - `mode` applies to the tmp file at creation (0600 for sensitive state),
 *   so the final file never exists with looser permissions.
 * - The tmp file is created in the target's directory (same filesystem, so
 *   rename stays atomic). Parent dirs are NOT created — callers that need
 *   mkdir own that decision (and its mode).
