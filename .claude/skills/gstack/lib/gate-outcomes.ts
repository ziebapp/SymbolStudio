/**
 * INV-1 gate outcome contract: every gate or outside review ends as
 * `ran` (with findings or a verdict), `not_run` (gstack chose not to run it) or
 * `unavailable` (it tried and could not). Each reason code maps to one state,
 * one stable anchor in docs/troubleshooting.md and one fix action; the
 * validator prints these lines and test/troubleshooting-anchors.test.ts checks
 * every anchor exists. Add a row here before printing a new reason anywhere.
