   Include changed and adjacent behavior, including selected uncommitted/new files.
   Clarify an ambiguous target or contract before side effects.
2. **Limit the methods.**
   Functional-only runs must not read browser setup, methodology, verification or bootstrap.
   Read installed /devex-review only for explicit installation, onboarding,

   A CLI/API alone is not DX scope. Keep each surface's evidence separate.
3. **Establish isolation.** Default to owned isolated fixtures. Resolve paths,
   symlinks, stores and downstream destinations before commands: localhost may
   forward to production. Unknown ownership blocks the probe. Production access,
   destruction or external mutation needs specific permission naming the target,
   operation and effect; invocation alone is not permission.
4. **Announce the boundaries.** State the target, surfaces, tools, permitted writes

1. Read ${sectionPath(ctx, 'qa', 'scope')} in full and select the surfaces.
2. Read the selected surface methods below in full.

${generateQAMethodReads(ctx)}

${reportOnly ? `Await each successful Read result before continuing. A supplied target, isolation
description, section index or remembered method is not a completed instruction Read.
Do not repeat a Read already completed in this invocation; reuse only its acknowledged
full contents. If either required Read is missing, complete it now before Charter and preflight.
` : ''}Missing or unreadable assets, prerequisites or permission block affected probes, not independent safe checks. Report QA setup blockers.

## 1. Charter and preflight

Reuse resolved REPORT_DIR; otherwise own a fresh \`.gstack/qa-reports\` subdirectory.
Write a **charter** per behavior: contract, risk, entrypoint, isolation, exit condition, source, commands and inputs. Save charters as Markdown in the report.

${reportOnly ? '' : `For /review and /ship, no plan/server is required.
Stop after 5 minutes or 12 probes, whichever comes first (SECONDS=300 across surfaces).
Explicit plan checks and revalidation remain required beyond this smoke budget.`}
For /qa and /qa-only:
- Browser Quick: SECONDS=180. Browser Full/Regression: SECONDS=900.
- Functional Full, Quick and Regression have no default total timer.
Set SECONDS to the shorter mode/caller limit; an unlimited mode uses the caller's bound.
Without a total time limit, do not create DEADLINE_FILE; announce finite command timeouts.
Stop when scoped contracts are tested or blocked.
Clocks/checkpoints use REPORT_DIR; mixed standalone runs use REPORT_DIR/browser and REPORT_DIR/functional, with one final report at REPORT_DIR. Caller paths win.
Names used below (quote every path):
- PROBE_DIR: this surface's owned probe directory per the line above. DEADLINE_FILE: \`PROBE_DIR/deadline.json\`, which exists only for a bounded run.
- SECONDS: the total probe budget set above. NNN: a fresh three-digit ID (001, 002, ...) for each capture or checkpoint; never reuse one.
- DEADLINE_TOOL = \`${quoteSafePath(ctx.paths.binDir)}/gstack-qa-deadline\`, the deadline guard: \`start\` creates DEADLINE_FILE, \`status\` prints \`remainingMs\` and \`expired\`, and \`run\` executes one command, stopping it at the deadline.
- EVIDENCE_TOOL = \`${quoteSafePath(ctx.paths.binDir)}/gstack-qa-evidence\`, the functional evidence recorder: \`capture\` runs one command, stores its exit code, stdout and stderr under \`PROBE_DIR/.qa-evidence/NNN/\`, and prints status \`complete\`, \`incomplete\` or \`sensitive\`.

Start once before baseline: \`bun DEADLINE_TOOL start DEADLINE_FILE SECONDS [EARLIER_UTC]\` if bounded.
EARLIER_UTC = caller's absolute deadline, if set.
Functional: \`bun EVIDENCE_TOOL capture PROBE_DIR NNN [--public] --deadline DEADLINE_FILE -- COMMAND ARGS\`.
Unbounded: use \`--timeout-ms MS\` instead of \`--deadline DEADLINE_FILE\`.
--public requires approved public/synthetic output; EVIDENCE_TOOL screens credentials. For complete private captures, await a safe Read of \`PROBE_DIR/.qa-evidence/NNN/observation.json\` (the decoded stdout). Sensitive/incomplete captures cannot anchor checkpoints.
Bounded browsers: \`bun DEADLINE_TOOL run DEADLINE_FILE -- COMMAND ARGS\`. No detached probes.
Never reset DEADLINE_FILE/bypass DEADLINE_TOOL. Expiry or an invalid/missing DEADLINE_FILE stops probes; report unfinished coverage. QA_DEADLINE receipts are not observations.

## 2. Probe loop

Each probe is one native command/interaction plus checks, excluding bookkeeping.
Never batch probes.

1. First demonstrate success: output AND durable effects. Guard if bounded; await completion.
2. **Decide whether another probe is needed.** If bounded, run \`bun DEADLINE_TOOL status DEADLINE_FILE\`.
   If expired or no safe next probe remains, STOP exploration; write the report (§4), not a checkpoint.
${reportOnly ? `   **Classify the last result before copying it.** For public or synthetic observations,
   retain the entire result unchanged, including owned fixture paths, IDs, hashes and
   existing credential placeholders. An absolute state path is not itself a secret.
   For actual secrets/private payloads, withhold those values and disclose the redaction
   and replay limits in the report. If no safe exact observation can be retained,
   stop the affected probe chain; never invent a substitute path, identity or state.
` : ''}   **Publish before probing.** Create (browser) or compose (functional) \`exploration-NNN.json\` in the probe directory, beside its deadline if bounded, with exactly four top-level fields:
   observationCommand: last completed probe's full outer command, including guard.
   observed: its exact decoded child JSON (no wrapper/extra keys), or its full non-JSON text.
${reportOnly ? `   For guarded text, copy the complete span between the guard's started and finished receipt lines.
   Keep its whitespace and content fences verbatim. Do not summarize, relabel or add timing text.
   The guard adds one newline before its finished receipt; that separator is not child text.
   For unguarded text, copy the complete result instead.
   If capture is incomplete, report that limit instead of reconstructing it.
` : ''}   hypothesis: why nextCommand. nextCommand: exact command/request, guarded if bounded.
   Preserve every safe program-JSON key/value and identity hash unchanged.
   Withhold unsafe values, disclose limits and stop that chain.
   Check fields before publication. No drafts/placeholders or invented safe-path redactions; corrections cannot repair published notes.
   Functional: do not write this file; the next capture publishes it: \`bun EVIDENCE_TOOL capture PROBE_DIR NNN --deadline DEADLINE_FILE --after PREV --hypothesis 'why' -- CMD\` (PREV: the last complete capture's ID). EVIDENCE_TOOL supplies observed; never transcribe it.
   Browser checkpoints use Write.
   Wait for successful checkpoint publication before dispatch.
   Never backfill or overwrite notes.
3. Run that exact probe; DEADLINE_TOOL enforces the deadline when bounded.
   Report refusals as not-run; retain initial state/inputs/results. Repeat from step 2.
4. Replay the exact failing command/request from the same initial fixture state via steps 2–3 (same native command, fresh capture ID)
   ${reportOnly ? 'to confirm it' : 'before repair'}, then minimize via those gates. Expiry leaves confirmation/minimization incomplete.
   Another input or a regression test is not that replay.
${reportOnly ? `5. If the user or another process changes source, commands or fixtures, review the affected
   contracts and return to step 2 for each affected revalidation (unproven=affected). Do not make product changes yourself.
   Keep the original limits/notes; update outcomes only from fresh evidence.` : `5. After source/commands/fixtures change, re-review and return to step 2 for each affected revalidation (unproven=affected). Keep limits/notes; status requires fresh evidence.`}

## 3. Parent handoff

${reportOnly ? `Never change product code, tests, configuration, dependencies or Git through any tool,
including shell, rename, deletion, commit, stash or edit-then-restore. Return test_stub proposals
with their failing contract and expected assertion; never create tests or freeze buggy output.` : `- **/qa:** parent owns severity, root-cause and Phase 8 regression gates before verified repair.
- **/review:** return before Fix-First; test_stub proposals require ASK approval.
- **Planning:** propose charters only; no execution.

Choose the smallest native test: unit for logic, integration for state/requests; E2E only if smaller tests miss the journey, not automatically both.
Mock only unrelated services.
Never freeze buggy output, weaken tests or delete valid red tests.`}

## 4. Final report

Use the surface report template; link each checkpoint. Separate browser scores, functional outcomes and proposed/executed tests.
Write PROBE_DIR/annotations.json {evidence: [{capture, command, contract, expected, classification}], limits} (browser-only: evidence [], checkpoints in limits); before Markdown \`bun EVIDENCE_TOOL materialize PROBE_DIR annotations.json\` (fills observed/metadata; prints reportLinks; runs once per PROBE_DIR); you classify. Annotate every safe capture, including failures/replays: an omitted capture is withheld and keeps the verdict inconclusive. Classify a capture taken before an input change \`superseded\`; it closes when the same command reran on current inputs. Disclose withheld/incomplete evidence.
Evidence is invocation-local${reportOnly ? '.' : '; /ship reruns once per invocation.'}
Missing prerequisites/expectations/observations, timeouts and refusal never pass.
Pass requires all required current-input contracts to pass with no required remainder.
${reportOnly ? 'Report blocked, inconclusive and not-run coverage without claiming success.' : `Required failure leaves /review incomplete and /ship blocked unless the user explicitly accepts that named risk; noninteractive runs return blocked. Only nonbehavioral diffs may be not applicable (give a reason); prompts/templates are behavioral.`}`;
}

export function generateQAFunctional(_ctx: TemplateContext): string {
  return `# Functional QA with repository-native tools

Use documented repository commands, CLI/API clients and job/queue tools, not a new
harness or browser substitution.

## Functional modes

For /qa and /qa-only, within the selected scope:
- **Full** (default): cover every applicable documented contract below.
- **Quick** (\`--quick\`): check success and the highest-risk changed edge; mark other
  contracts not run.
- **Regression** (\`--regression <previous-report>\`): before probes, read the supplied
  functional report and linked replay evidence. A missing, unreadable or wrong-target
  baseline blocks regression mode. A browser-only \`baseline.json\` is not a functional
  baseline. Re-establish owned setup; replay prior failed probes against the documented
  expectation, never recorded buggy output, then check changed adjacent behavior.
  Preserve the prior report; report fixed, still failing and new findings separately.
  Missing safe replay inputs block affected probes, never count as passes.

Mixed runs apply each surface's mode separately. /review and /ship retain their caller's
bounded smoke and explicit plan checks, not Full exploration.

## Contract map

Record each contract/source, isolated setup, exact probe, expectation and outcome:
pass/fail/blocked/not run/inconclusive/not applicable (reason).

| Contract | Observe |
|---|---|
| Successful execution | Expected return/output and final business effect, not just launch/acceptance |
| Invalid/missing input | Declared rejection, correct status and no forbidden state change |
| Authentication/authorization | Valid identity, missing/invalid identity, wrong owner/role and durable no-effect boundary |
| CLI process contract | Exact exit code, stdout and stderr separately; resulting file/state changes |
| State transitions | Initial, intermediate and completed/failed states and their permitted transitions |
| Timeout/cancellation | Deadline, partial state, termination of owned work and recovery |
| Retry | Attempts/backoff/terminal state promised by the repository; no unbounded retry |
| Duplicates/idempotency | Repeated request/event and number of durable effects under the documented guarantee |
| Concurrency/order | Controlled competing operations in both relevant completion orders; final invariant |
| Partial-failure recovery | Interrupt after an effect, restart/replay, inspect completion/dead-letter state and duplicates |

Do not impose universal exactly-once delivery. Separate acceptance, enqueue, processing,
retry/dead-letter and final effect; 2xx is not completion. Expected rejection/injected
failure may pass; a missing service preventing execution blocks coverage.

## Execute and retain evidence

1. Apply the shared isolation/permission preflight. Verify cwd, command, environment
   NAMES and safe reset; use synthetic data/credentials.
2. Follow the shared exploratory loop's order and written checkpoints.
   For every probe, inspect initial/final durable state and retain exit/status and
   stdout/stderr separately without masking failure.
3. On timeout, retain partial output/state and stop only owned work. Record setup errors
   and untested contracts; never patch product code to hide missing prerequisites.
4. Record exact command or method/path/headers/body, setup/reset, expected contract/source,
   observed output/state, revision/runtime, evidence paths and limits. Secrets are referenced
   only by environment name. Disclose replay limits caused by redaction.
5. Use \`templates/functional-report-template.md\` relative to the installed QA SKILL.md.
   Preserve evidence before owned cleanup and disclose leftovers. Return to the caller
   without expanding discovery authority.`;

**3. Run smoke and plan checks.**
Follow the shared Probe loop for smoke checks and replays until the smoke limit.
Then run required plan checks and revalidation, even after smoke expires, using the same procedure but no smoke guard; never reset the clock.

Await clock/guard results before acting. When the caller's deadline expires, mark unfinished checks not-run.

**4. Check freshness before reporting.**
Before every completion report or log, even with zero fixes or skipped specialists:
a. Read agent/user updates and await results without batching them with reporting/logging.
b. Compare each probe's recorded source, tests, contracts, commands and fixtures (or input fingerprint)
   with current inputs, even without updates. Never rerun valid current passes.
c. Re-review changed or uncertain coverage and repeat step 3 for affected checks.
   Reporting reserves cannot stop required revalidation within the caller's deadline.
d. Compare again after revalidation or edits/updates. Failed or unavailable Reads or
   insufficient time block affected required checks. List failed, blocked, inconclusive and not-run checks.
   Report clean/completed only when all required checks pass on current inputs; optional untested ideas do not block it.

Return verified defects to Fix-First: \`path\`, \`line\`, \`category\`,
\`fingerprint: path:line:category\`, replay, \`test_stub\`. Use checklist severity;
unmatched functional failures are \`functional-contract\`, \`CRITICAL\`.
