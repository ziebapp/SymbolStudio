 * generate-plan-mode-handshake.ts that used to sit at this position and told
 * interactive review skills to emit an exit-and-rerun handshake instead of
 * running their interactive STOP-Ask workflow.
 *
 * Text is the same "Plan Mode Safe Operations" + "Skill Invocation During Plan
 * Mode" blocks that previously lived at the tail of generateCompletionStatus().
 * Only the position changes. All skills (not just interactive: true) see this.
 *
 * Composition position: index 1 in scripts/resolvers/preamble.ts — after
 * generatePreambleBash (so _SESSION_ID / _BRANCH / _TEL env vars exist before
 * any plan-mode-aware telemetry) and before generateUpgradeCheck + onboarding
 * gates. See ceo-plan 2026-04-24 "remove vestigial plan-mode handshake" for
 * the full rationale.

  return `## Plan Mode Safe Operations

Host and system plan-mode restrictions and the user's current scope take precedence over any skill; a skill cannot grant itself an exception to read-only mode. Where the host permits them, these inform the plan: \`$B\`, \`$D\`, \`codex exec\`/\`codex review\`, temp prompts, writes to \`~/.gstack/\`, writes to the plan file, and \`open\` for generated artifacts. If the host blocks one, skip it, say so, and continue the permitted work.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

export function generateCompletionStatus(ctx: TemplateContext): string {
  return `## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: \`STATUS\`, \`REASON\`, \`ATTEMPTED\`, \`RECOMMENDATION\`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, review the session for durable learnings and log each one.
The review runs every time, not only when something felt noteworthy. A durable
learning is a project quirk, command fix, pitfall, or pattern that would save
5+ minutes in a future session. If the review genuinely surfaces none, state
"No durable learnings this session" in your completion summary — an explicit
empty result, not a skipped step.

\`\`\`bash
${ctx.paths.binDir}/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
\`\`\`

Do not log obvious facts or one-time transient errors.

## Telemetry (run last)

After workflow completion, log telemetry with ONE command. OUTCOME is
success/error/abort/unknown; \`SESSION_ID\` and \`TEL_START\` are the values the
preamble's skill-start output echoed. It also drains the artifacts-sync queue
(the former skill-end sync step — do not run gstack-brain-sync separately).

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes telemetry to
\`$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/analytics/\`, matching preamble analytics writes.

\`\`\`bash
${ctx.paths.binDir}/gstack-skill-end --skill "${ctx.skillName}" --outcome OUTCOME \\
  --session-id "SESSION_ID" --tel-start "TEL_START" --used-browse USED_BROWSE \\
  --error-message "ERROR_MESSAGE" --failed-step "FAILED_STEP" 2>/dev/null || true
\`\`\`

Replace \`OUTCOME\` and \`USED_BROWSE\` (yes/no) before running; substitute
\`SESSION_ID\`/\`TEL_START\` from the skill-start echoes. \`ERROR_MESSAGE\`/\`FAILED_STEP\`
are "" unless outcome is error. If the command is missing (stale install), skip
telemetry — it never blocks the workflow.

## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (\`/plan-*-review\`, \`/codex review\`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with \`## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT\` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like \`/ship\`, \`/qa\`, \`/review\`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. ${ctx.skillName === 'plan-eng-review' ? 'Use the selected report file and honor the Review record and write policy for every artifact.' : 'Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.'}`;
}
