 *
 * Semantics note: unlike the legacy flag (which yielded to an existing
 * top-level `web_search` in config.toml), the -c form explicitly overrides
 * it. Deliberate: gstack wants deterministic cached search for review
 * invocations. Native `codex review` disables web search regardless of

 *
 * Emits ONE self-contained bash block that runs `gstack-codex-probe` as a
 * command (one subcommand per check), so it works from bash, zsh or sh and
 * nothing it learns persists to later blocks except the echoed mode. It:
 *   1. reads the `codex_reviews` master switch,
 *   2. checks that the probe is installed and executable
 *      (`CODEX_MODE: helper_unavailable` with the fix otherwise),
 *   3. runs `command -v codex` (literal — keeps the e2e substring assertion),
 *      then `check-auth`, `check-sandbox`, `probe-model` and `check-version`,
 *   4. logs the relevant `log-event` for each non-ready outcome,
 *   5. sets ONE canonical mode var and echoes `CODEX_MODE: <mode>` so the agent
 *      gates later blocks on the echoed value.
 *
 * Mode values: `disabled` (config off) | `helper_unavailable` (the probe is
 * missing or not executable) | `not_installed` | `not_authed` |
 * `broken_install` | `sandbox_unavailable` | `model_unusable` | `quota_exhausted` |
 * `unverified` (echoed as `unverified (rate_limited)` after a probe-time 429) | `ready`.
 * The path is host-rewritten at gen-skill-docs time (pathRewrites), so the
 * literal `~/.claude/skills/gstack` is correct here and becomes `$GSTACK_ROOT`
 * etc. for non-Claude hosts.
 *
 * `disabledBehavior` controls the `disabled`-mode interpretation, which is the
 * one branch that legitimately differs per caller (D1):
 *   - `skip-all` (plan / doc reviews): disabled means no extra review step at
 *     all — skip the section, no Claude fallback.
 *   - `codex-only` (diff adversarial): disabled gates only the Codex passes; the
 *     free Claude adversarial subagent still runs.

- **\`broken_install\`** — the CLI is on PATH but cannot execute (spawn ENOENT, non-executable binary, missing vendor payload). Print: "Codex is installed but its binary cannot run — Codex passes skipped. Reinstall: \`npm install -g @openai/codex\`." Relay the probe's HINT lines. ${nativeRoute}

- **\`quota_exhausted\`** — Codex usage limit: relay the probe's lines verbatim (reset time, retry); no more Codex calls this run. ${nativeRoute}
- **\`sandbox_unavailable\`** — Codex's sandbox cannot start here (containers without user namespaces); the probe printed the reason and fix. No paid call ran; outside coverage is unavailable. ${nativeRoute}
- **\`ready\`** or **\`unverified\`** — run the Codex pass below. \`unverified\` means the model check timed out or, with \`(rate_limited)\`, hit a 429; say so, and let the pass's own verdict decide.`;
