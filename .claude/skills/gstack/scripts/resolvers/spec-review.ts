function generateOfficeHoursSpecReviewLoop(): string {
  return `## Spec Review Loop

Run an adversarial review before presenting the final document to the user.
Follow the calling workflow's approval steps.
The reviewer's saved JSON is the complete verdict. A prose summary is not a second
finding inventory: the report helper preserves every problem/remedy and counts the
records mechanically. Do not rewrite, condense, deduplicate, or recount its blocks.

**Step 1: Prepare and dispatch the reviewer**

Create a fresh review directory next to the design:

\`\`\`bash
mktemp -d "<design-path>.review.XXXXXX"
\`\`\`
Remember its actual path for this invocation. Keep these evidence files with the design.
Maximum 3 iterations total. Before EACH dispatch, generate the complete prompt using
all preceding valid round files in order (omit them for round 1):

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-office-hours-review prepare --design "<design-path>" --out-dir "<review-directory>" "<round-1.json if present>" "<round-2.json if present>"
\`\`\`

Omit absent arguments rather than passing placeholders. Users get 3 rounds; only
when a caller sets a lower review round limit, add \`--max-rounds <N>\` with that
same value to every prepare, check, and finalize command. The helper chooses the next
round and writes \`round-N.prompt.md\`. It includes the full finding schema, all five
review dimensions (Completeness, Consistency, Clarity, Scope, Feasibility), the
office-hours coaching contract, and the COMPLETE preceding JSON verdict. It also
saves the design as reviewed (\`round-N.design.md\`). Round 1 is a full review;
rounds 2 and 3 are delta re-reviews of the exact design diff since the last round,
so prepare every round in the same review directory and do not edit the design
between prepare and its review.

Use the Agent tool with ${FOREGROUND_IF_AVAILABLE} and its returned \`dispatch\`
string unchanged as the prompt. ${BACKGROUND_RECOVERY} The reviewer must Read the entire prepared prompt
file before reviewing the design. Do not recreate the prompt, copy selected fields,
or summarize prior findings. A parent Read does not deliver the file to the reviewer.
The reviewer has fresh context and cannot see the brainstorming conversation.
Its prepared contract requires a complete JSON Write, sealed by the dispatch's
\`Seal:\` command, and a one-line \`OFFICE_HOURS_VERDICT\` receipt as its entire response.
It protects the required coaching and Assignment sections, distinguishes unknown
customer facts from committed behavior, and requires evidence for every prior status.

**Step 2: Check stop conditions, then fix and re-dispatch**

After each verdict, BEFORE fixing any findings or dispatching again, validate the
saved files with the helper. Pass the reviewer's entire response unchanged as the
receipt (a lone \`OFFICE_HOURS_VERDICT\` line; with a quote, backtick, \`$\` or \`\\\` it is
malformed) and list every completed round in order:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-office-hours-review check --receipt "<receipt line>" "<round-1.json>" "<round-2.json if present>" "<round-3.json if present>"
\`\`\`

A missing, malformed, or mismatched receipt fails the check: that attempt is a failed review.

Omit absent arguments rather than passing placeholders.
**Convergence guard and stopping rules:** Each finding is blocking or minor. Only
blocking findings require another round. Read its stop reason:
- PASS: no blocking findings remain. Any minor findings are recorded, not fixed,
  and never justify another round; proceed to Step 3.
- CONVERGENCE: the reviewer explicitly marked a blocking prior obligation
  persisting with a concrete prior/current finding pair and document evidence.
  Stop even if new findings appear. Shared topic labels or new refinements alone
  are insufficient.
- MAX_ITERATIONS: round 3 completed (or the caller's lower round limit); stop.
- CONTINUE: fix only the blocking findings in the design, then return to Step 1
  to prepare and dispatch the next review. Do not edit for minor findings
  mid-loop: they stay recorded for the user, and new text only gives the next
  diff more to review. Its reviewer checks every prior finding and raises new
  blocking findings only for problems your changes introduced or exposed.

On a stop, do not fix again or re-dispatch. Run the finalizer before approval:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-office-hours-review finalize --design "<design-path>" "<round-1.json>" "<round-2.json if present>" "<round-3.json if present>"
\`\`\`

It installs the complete \`## Reviewer Concerns\` section directly from the JSON.
Recording concerns does not mark them fixed. Do not edit that generated section.
Then proceed to Step 3 and the existing user approval.

If the subagent fails, times out, or is unavailable — stop the loop and present the
document unreviewed. Tell the user: "Spec review unavailable — presenting unreviewed doc."
A missing or invalid verdict is an explicit review failure, never PASS. Preserve the
failed output and its error. Finalize with \`--unreviewed "<actual failure cause>"\`
and only the preceding valid round files (none if round 1 failed); their known
concerns remain visible. Do not fabricate JSON or hide a completed verdict behind
UNREVIEWED. The independent review remains a quality bonus, not an approval gate.

**Step 3: Report and persist metrics**

The finalizer prints the exact Spec Review block, quality score, and metrics. Tell the user the
result using that block; link the design and saved verdicts for details. Report
finding observations across rounds separately from unresolved final findings.
Confirmed resolutions require explicit later reviewer evidence; attempted fix
rounds are counted separately and never described as successful fixes.

When writing a completion report, write its other sections normally, then run the
same finalizer with \`--report "<report-path>"\` after the report exists. This installs
its authoritative \`## Spec Review\` section and Disposition mechanically. Do not
summarize or replace that section afterward; refer to it elsewhere instead of
inventing duplicate counts. Preserve the Assignment, coaching, approval, and Handoff.

Append the helper's actual metrics to the existing analytics log (telemetry is
best-effort and must not block approval):
\`\`\`bash
GSTACK_STATE_ROOT=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-paths --get GSTACK_STATE_ROOT); : "\${GSTACK_STATE_ROOT:?gstack-paths failed; reinstall with ./setup or /gstack-upgrade}"
mkdir -p "$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/analytics"
echo '{"skill":"office-hours","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","iterations":ITERATIONS,"issues_found":FOUND,"issues_fixed":FIXED,"remaining":REMAINING,"quality_score":SCORE}' >> "$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/analytics/spec-review.jsonl" 2>/dev/null || true
\`\`\`
Use iterations, issues_found, issues_fixed, remaining, and quality_score from the
helper; its remaining_blocking and remaining_minor split the remaining count. FOUND counts finding observations across rounds; FIXED counts only
reviewer-confirmed resolutions. An unavailable score is null, never invented.`;

Prompt the subagent with:
- ${ceo ? 'Both saved absolute paths, or both complete labeled texts if either input is not persisted: CEO scope summary and current amended working plan. No other conversation context.' : 'The file path of the document just written'}
${ceo ? `- "Read both inputs in full. Evaluate them together on all five dimensions.

  input is unavailable or incomplete, report that failure instead of grading
  partial input."` : `- "Read this document and review it on 5 dimensions. For each dimension, note PASS or
  list specific issues with suggested fixes. At the end, output a quality score (1-10)

**Dimensions:**
${ceo ? `1. **Completeness** — requirements and edge cases.

- **PASS:** Stop the loop.

If the reviewer returns issues:
1. Fix each issue in the document on disk (use Edit tool)
2. Re-dispatch the reviewer subagent with the updated document
3. Maximum 3 iterations total

**Convergence guard:** If the reviewer returns the same issues on consecutive iterations
(the fix didn't resolve them or the reviewer disagrees with the fix), stop the loop
and persist those issues as "Reviewer Concerns" in the document rather than looping
further.

If the subagent fails, times out, or is unavailable — skip the review loop entirely.
Tell the user: "Spec review unavailable — presenting unreviewed doc." The document is
already written to disk; the review is a quality bonus, not a gate.`}

Recording the **0H spec-review metrics** is
required when writing is permitted, even if the reviewer failed. Append the
actual outcome below; failed mkdir or append stops the review. When writing is
forbidden, show the actual fields as not persisted and continue without writing.
