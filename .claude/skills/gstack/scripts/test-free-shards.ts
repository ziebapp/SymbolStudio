/**
 * test-free-shards — enumerate, shard, curate, and run the free test suite.
 *
 * Four jobs:
 *   1. Enumeration. Walk `browse/test/`, `test/`, `make-pdf/test/` and return
 *      every `*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}` that isn't a paid-eval test.
 *   2. Sharding. Duration-pack local and isolated CI runs. Legacy --shard
 *      selection retains stable hash assignment.
 *   3. Curation (Windows-safe filter). Scan each test's content for POSIX-only
 *      patterns (`/bin/bash`, `sh -c`, raw `/tmp/`, `chmod`, `xargs`). Files
 *      that match are excluded from the Windows-safe subset — they would fail
 *      on `windows-latest` no matter how the runner shards them.
 *   4. Execution. Run `bun test` children through the shared shard engine
 *      (scripts/lib/shard-engine.ts runShardChild) and refuse to trust their
 *      exit code alone: every byte of output is classified strictly, so a child that exits 0 without bun's
 *      terminal summary (a mid-suite process.exit truncation), with `(fail)`
 *      result lines, or with fewer files run than planned is a FAILURE. An
 *      external wall-clock timeout SIGKILLs the child's process group and
 *      reports the shard as timed-out — distinct from failed.
 *
 * Execution strategy (decision ledger V3/D6 — evaluate the Bun built-in
 * first; probed 2026-08 on Bun 1.3.13):
 *   - Full-suite runs (`bun test` via package.json, `bun run test:free`) use
 *     N CONCURRENT SHARD PROCESSES, serial within each (the paid runner's
 *     model). A single `--parallel` invocation was probed and initially
 *     adopted, then abandoned: three distinct Bun 1.3.13 worker pathologies
 *     (segfault + crash-retry wedge, skipped-file hooks stalling a worker,
 *     spawn-heavy files hanging under load) each stalled the whole
 *     invocation, while process shards isolate any wedge to its own shard.
 *     Original --parallel probe results, kept for the record: it
 *     showed --parallel (a) prints the standard `Ran N tests across M files`
 *     terminal summary, (b) exits non-zero when any file fails, (c) runs each
 *     file in its own worker process (distinct pids, no shared globals), and
 *     (d) converts a mid-suite process.exit(0) — which silently truncates a
 *     serial run at exit 0 — into a per-file `(crashed: exited)` failure with
 *     a complete summary and exit 1. Strictly SAFER than the serial path and
 *     ~2x faster on a 6-file probe (0.22s -> 0.11s wall, 280% CPU); the win
 *     grows with suite size since the serial suite measured 454s.
 *   - Legacy runs (`--shards M --shard i`) keep the hash-partitioned
 *     one-child-per-shard path. Cross-runner partitioning must be
 *     deterministic and per-file stable, so bun's own `--shard=M/N`
 *     (round-robin over sorted paths — every assignment shifts when a file
 *     lands) is not used, and there are no static per-file weight lists.
 *     Shard indices are STABLE: assignFilesToShards never renumbers on
 *     occupancy, and an empty shard is a fast no-op success.
 *
 * Adapted from the McGluut/gstack fork's test-free-shards.ts (190 LOC). The
 * Windows-safe filter is upstream-original — codex flagged that sharding alone
 * doesn't fix POSIX-bound tests, so we curate the subset that actually runs
 * on the windows-latest CI job.
 *
 * Output contract (v1.66): the full child stream ALWAYS lands in a per-run
 * private log under .context/free-test-logs (path printed at start and in the
 * epilogue). The console is quiet by default — only the runner's own
 * [test:free] lines, `(fail)` result lines, bun error/crash markers
 * (`error:`, `panic:`, `crashed`, `Unhandled error`), and the terminal
 * `Ran N tests across M files` summary reach it; `--verbose` restores full
 * forwarding. After every run a stable epilogue names the failing tests
 * (attributed to files via bun's `path/to/file.test.ts:` chunk headers),
 * crashed+retried workers, and — on a wall-timeout kill — the wedge-suspect
 * files. The strict classifier consumes the FULL stream regardless of what
 * the console shows.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 124 wall-clock timeout.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/test-free-shards.ts                            # full suite, N concurrent shard processes
 *   bun run scripts/test-free-shards.ts --list                     # show all

 *   bun run scripts/test-free-shards.ts --wall-timeout 600         # override the kill deadline
 *   bun run scripts/test-free-shards.ts --verbose                  # forward the full child stream
